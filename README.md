# QVSR-Likert-ML-prediction
 ML model to predict outcome variables from survey data

The codes can be accessed in the two notebooks QVSR_Likert-Data prep_letter writing_predict-proba.ipynb and QVSR_Likert-Data prep_turnout-gun-wall-predict_proba.ipynb. 
The policy tree algorithm is being run in the R files- QVSR_Policytree_letter and QVSR_Policytree_turnout-donate. The R files are being run within the respective notebooks.
